Spell-Check:

This is some code I wrote for an interview once. Basically the question went something like this (paraphrasing):

You are given a word(s) with spelling mistakes (of certian kinds which I need to go back and look up), and given a dictionary of correctly spelled words, find the closest suggestion for the correctly misspelled word by replacing one letter at a time.  The dictionary I used in this projet is the unix/linux dictionary (ex: /usr/share/dict/words).

One can easily see that this is a classical AI search problem.  In this project, I produced an algorithm that abstracts away the specific search algorithim (BSF, DFS, A*).

How to build:

Should be farily easy, as the source is there and the jar dependencies have been added directly to the project.  Normally I would use maven or some other build tool, but this was written to be fast and dirty.
